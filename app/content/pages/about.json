  "content": "Black people have a unique relationship with sex and its related culture. We are stigmatized, disrespected, fetishized, unrepresented, abused, hyper-sexualized, and or ignored by the world and honestly sometimes our own community. I intend to help change that.
I believe doing so starts by the inclusion of ALL Black people no matter how they identify including but not limited to birth sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender presentation.
The show explores Black sex culture, Sex education, and the Lifestyle as it pertains to kinks, fetishes, and paraphilias within the Black community.."
